## General Cube Info

The All Spark Cube was built in 2012-2013 by Adaptive Computing and friends. More 
info is available here:

## Cube Client Libraries

To interact with the All Spark Cube, you'll need a client library for your 
preferred programming language. There are currently cube clients available for 
<a href="#python_client">Python</a> and <a href="#java_client">Java</a>. Skip 
to the relevant section for your language.

#### <a id="python_client">Python Client Install</a>

1. Install the [python client library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/all_spark_cube_client/) using pip. If you don't have pip installed, get it 
[here.](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html)

    $ pip install all_spark_cube_client

You can safely ignore the 10 or so warnings generated by pip, these are a 
part of the underlying [Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/) library, and don't
affect the cube client library.


2. Download and run the [Hello World](https://github.com/chadharrington/all_spark_cube/blob/master/software/clients/python_client/examples/helloworld.py) demo:

    $ wget -O helloworld.py http://git.io/hellopycube
    $ python helloworld.py

The cube should update and you should see "Success..." on your command line. If 
you get errors instead, open the helloworld.py file and make sure the HOST 
parameter is set to the correct network address for the cube. You should also 
make sure the cube is turned on and reachable over the network.

#### <a id="java_client">Java Client Install</a>
